# 2025-12-03 - Health mode - evolvable interaction values

Vary vertical transmission rate, allow symbionts to evolve along the parasitism-mutualism spectrum.

Hypothesis: higher vertical transmission rates select for mutualism, lower vertical transmission rates select for more parastism

Hypothesis: In runs where more mutualism evolves, we expect host evolution to be more constrained than in runs where more parasitism evolves.
